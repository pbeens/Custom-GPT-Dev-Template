# Custom GPT & Gemini Gem Template Repository

This repository serves as a template and workspace for developing, versioning, and testing System Prompts for Custom GPTs, alternatively, Gemini Gems. 

> **Note**: For the purposes of this file, we will assume Custom GPTs, though all guidance applies equally to Gemini Gems or any similar AI-powered assistant platform.

> **Latest Version**: The latest version of this template can always be found at [github.com/pbeens/Custom-GPT-Dev-Template](https://github.com/pbeens/Custom-GPT-Dev-Template).

## Features
*   **Version Control**: Track every iteration of your system prompts.
*   **Structured Testing**: Use defined personas and skills to validate performance.
*   **AI-Native Workflow**: Designed to work seamlessly with AI coding assistants like Antigravity, GitHub Copilot, and Claude Code.

## Development Strategy
This project tracks the evolution of the System Prompt through:
1.  **Iterative Refinement**: Cycles of testing and improving.
2.  **Changelog Tracking**: documenting every significant change.
3.  **Persona Testing**: Simulating real-world user interactions.

## Development Instructions
For detailed instructions on how to use this template, set up your environment, and contribute to the prompt development, please refer to **[GEMINI.md](GEMINI.md)**.

> **Developers / AI Agents**: Please read `PROTOCOL.md` and `GEMINI.md` to understand the workflow.
